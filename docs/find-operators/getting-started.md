# Getting Started

Compass uses Find Operators to do complex queries, so every query that isn't strictly `find * where column = "bar"`, needs a Find Operator to be done.

## The Find Operators

Here is a list with all the find operators:

- [Between](./between)
- [Exist](./exist)
- [In](./in)
- [IsNull](./is-null)
- [LessThanOrEqual](./less-than-or-equal)
- [LessThan](./less-than)
- [Like](./like)
- [MoreThanOrEqual](./more-than-or-equal)
- [MoreThan](./more-than)
- [Not](./not)
